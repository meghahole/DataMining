# Used Olympics data and found below insights:

Insight - At the end accuracy shows that we can predict Weightlifting medals using hight and weight 96% accuratly.

## In short description of code:
1. If we start counting in 1964, the United States, Russia, Germany, and China have the most medals in the Olympics. They have all sent varied numbers of athletes to competitions over time and have performed better with larger contingents.
2. The years 1980 and 1984 were unusual, with the United States not participating in 1980 owing to Russia invading Afghanistan, and Russia retaliating in 1984 by not participating and initiating the friendship games.
3. We discovered intriguing insights by analyzing the most successful sporting activities in each top country, such as swimming in the USA, diving in China, wrestling in Russia, and athletics in general.
4. GDP has a favorable impact on a nation's number of medals earned!
The list of most accomplished athletes includes 50% Americans, the majority of them are swimmers!
5. Using linear regression on GDP, population, GDP_per_capita, and contingent size, we can estimate a country's medal total with an RMSE of only ~7 medals.
6. It is also possible to forecast the sports an athlete will play based solely on his height and weight. We utilized a very basic K-Nearest Neighbors model.
